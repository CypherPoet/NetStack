_A Combine-based networking stack for modern Swift projects. Use as-is &mdash; or as a starting point for your own utilities._

<p />


## Features

- ✅ Composable, Combine-based publisher primitives for constructing pipelines that map from URLRequests to `Data` and `Decodable` models.
- ✅ Utilities for URLRequest configuration.
- ✅ Utilities for mocking URLRequest responses in tests.


## Installation

`NetStack` ships with two [library products](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/product): `NetStack` and `NetStackTestUtils`.

### Xcode Projects

Select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency` and enter `https://github.com/CypherPoet/NetStack`.


### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `NetStack` as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/CypherPoet/NetStack", from: "0.0.1"),
    ],
    //...
)
```

From there, refer to it as a target dependency in any of your package's targets that need it.

`NetStack` "Core" can be referred to directly, and `NetStackTestUtils` can be referenced as a `product` name:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "MyLibrary",
        dependencies: [
          "NetStack",
        ],
        ...
    ),
    .testTarget(
        name: "MyLibraryTests",
        dependencies: [
          "MyLibrary",
          .product(name: "NetStackTestUtils", package: "NetStack"),
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

Then simply `import NetStack` and `import NetStackTestUtils` wherever you’d like to use them.

## Contributing

Contributions to `NetStack` are most welcome. Check out some of the [issue templates](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) for more info.



## 💻 Developing

### Requirements

- Xcode 12.0+ (for developing)


### 📜 Generating Documentation

Documentation is generated by [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/realm/jazzy#installation), and as soon as you have it set up, docs can be generated simply by running `jazzy` from the command line.

📝 Note that this will only generate a `docs` folder for you to view locally. This folder is being ignored by `git`, as an [action](./.github/workflows/PublishDocumentation.yml) exists to automatically generate docs and serve them on the project's `gh-pages` branch.


## 🏷 License

`NetStack` is available under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE file](./LICENSE) for more info.
